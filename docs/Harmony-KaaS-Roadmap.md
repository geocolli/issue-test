# Harmony : Harmony KaaS Roadmap

This document captures the high level roadmap and priorities over the next two quarters. It was agreed upon by the product and engineering teams on 9/6/2017.

The roadmap is also covered in the product Harmony KaaS overview deck [here](https://cisco.box.com/s/dyov8b6htgwyxc308z5q6r1tj68d7gke) (let me know if you don't have permissions to this).

# Overview

There are four primary drivers for Harmony KaaS:

1.  Hyperflex Integration
2.  Service Provider (Vaquero + KaaS)
3.  Direct Software sales to enterprises (VMware integration)
4.  OpenStack + KaaS as a single packaged private cloud product.

# Release Principles

Given the rapid pace of the overall effort, the decision has been made to time box releases. Releases will released on a fixed cadence. Best effort will be made to deliver prioritized features.
