# Harmony : Contiv team member responsibility</span>
| Name | Responsibilities | Skills | Interests |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bill Robinson | Technical leadership for Contiv and KaaS (I still help people on KaaS frequently), lots of code reviews, mentoring (officially and unofficially), helping with many git and Linux/Mac situations, architecture discussions, assisting with CI/testing infrastructure as necessary, occasionally writing code, de facto release manager (for now) | Ruby, git, Go, containers, nginx, Redis, PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, scaling websites/databases, LInux system administration | fintech, high-throughput "firm" real-time systems, using Haskell or Rust on real projects, crypto, security (SELinux, grsecurity, etc.)|
| Razvan Staretu | maintainer for contiv/ansible, contiv/install, contiv/netplugin & a few other repositories - helping with reviews for other repositories as well, sorting out the issues with the CI & making changes to the Jenkins CI setup (but not to the underlying infrastructure), providing bits of information about the background of certain things (why some things were done a certain way & background of some decisions made in the past) & about the code, helping with releases, investigating & sorting out issues related to the build & release, making the CI more reliable & faster, bumping dependencies, debugging Docker related issues, helping whenever possible | Go, shell scripting, C, ansible, Python, Linux containers: Docker (since 2013), LXD (since 2011), VM technologies: ESXi, VMware Workstation (2003+), VirtualBox (2014+), Vagrant (2014+), packer (2014+), Jenkins (2017+), testing  (mostly Go), other languages, not interested in these: PHP, Java | other things I do: optimize and make some parts of software/related processes more reliable (faster website loading, reducing the size of the assets and so on for websites; faster deployment of Docker image based setups, smaller download bundles, speeding up tests, making deployments more resilient, speeding up the CI), Docker engine maintainer since the end of 2013 (currently the moby/moby repository), advanced & high performance networking (data center, scalable setups), cloud deployment & related architecture - get a chance to learn more about this to automate more, software development processes (including CI & testing) and their optimization, fast and repeatable deployments, I wish to learn rust and get a chance to write Go code more often |
